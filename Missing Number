/*
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3].
2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 
2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
